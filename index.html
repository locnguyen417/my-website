      <h2>About USAFV</h2>
      <p>
        The United States Air Force (USAF) is the air service branch of the U.S. Department of Defense. It is one of the six branches of the U.S. Armed Forces and one of the eight uniformed services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Established on September 18, 1947, through the National Security Act, the USAF originated from the Army Air Forces and has since become the world’s largest air force. Its core missions include air superiority, global intelligence and surveillance, rapid mobility, strategic strike, and command and control.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Department of the Air Force, led by a civilian Secretary and overseen by the Chief of Staff, is part of the DoD’s military structure. Operational command is delegated to unified combatant commands, while administrative control remains with the Secretary and the Chief of Staff.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to combat operations, the USAF provides air support for ground and naval forces and engages in search and rescue missions. As of 2020, it operates over 5,500 aircraft, approximately 400 ICBMs, and has more than 600,000 active, reserve, guard, and civilian personnel.
